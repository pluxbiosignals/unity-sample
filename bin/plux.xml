A BaseDev device can be instantiated if a specific device functionality is not required.
A BaseDev instance can be promoted afterwards to a derived class instance, based on device properties.
This promotion is done by passing the BaseDev instance to the constructor of the derived class.
Alternatively, a derived class can be directly instantiated from the path string if a specific device functionality is required.
It is not possible to demote a derived class instance to a BaseDev instance.</remarks>
